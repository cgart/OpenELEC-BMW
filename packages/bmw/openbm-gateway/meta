PKG_LONGDESC="OpenBM-Gateway is a daemon running in the background and acting as a gateway between BMW's IBus and local clients connected over a network TCP stack. In this case an IBus interface is connected to the PC's serial port or to a virtual serial port through an USB device. The interface must support CTS line. Hence some hardware collision detection, or at least a simple bit comparator must be implemented. This function is provided for example by the TH3122 ic."
